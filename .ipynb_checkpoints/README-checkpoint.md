# Number-Guessing-Game
 Techdegree Data Analysis Project 1
 
In this project, I will build a console game. This game is called the Number Guessing Game.

The player will pick a number between 1 and 100. After a guess is made, the player will receive a hint of whether their guess is too high or too low. The next guess should be based off the hint received. If the guess is correct the game is done. The goal is to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. The  number of attempts each game is stored and will provide the player with the mean, median, mode, and personal high score.

Enjoy the game and have fun!
